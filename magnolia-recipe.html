                Strawberry Magnolia Recipe is a delicious recipe that will cheer your palate as summer approaches. It is a little different from the "Banana Magnolia Pudding" recipe that I published before, but you can be free about fruits and make the pudding in both recipes with peace of mind.
                
                While ready-made strawberries are starting to take their place on the counters, it is time to include strawberry summer desserts in the kitchens. I hope you will like it.

            <h3>Notes : </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You can use any other soft fruit instead of strawberries</li>
                <li>You can also use whipped cream instead of the cream used in the recipe, but if you use whipped cream with sugar, make sure to reduce the amount of sugar I mentioned in the recipe.</li>
                <li>Make sure the eggs you use are fresh. It should not shake when you take it in your hand and shake it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Take the milk and vanilla extract in a saucepan, bring to a boil over medium heat. It can overflow, be careful.</li>
                <li>In another bowl, whisk the eggs, starch, sugar and salt. Simply whisk until the starch has melted and the mixture is smooth.</li>
                <li>When the milk starts to foam around the edges, take it off the stove. Add it to the egg mixture that you whisk constantly. If you add the egg mixture without whisking, the hot milk will cook the egg immediately and your pudding will smell like eggs. In a sense, we season the egg mixture with hot milk.</li>
                <li>After adding all the milk in a controlled way, pour the mixture back into the milk pot and cook it by whisking constantly on medium low heat. If you make it on high heat, the mixture may cut. Be in control.</li>
                <li>When the mixture starts to boil, the eyes will become eyes and it will become thick. Whisk for another 5-10 seconds in this way, take it off the stove and add the butter immediately. Keep whisking until it melts.</li>
                <li>Pour the mixture into a bowl and cover it with cling film. The cling film should touch the pudding so that the pudding does not stick to the crust. Wait until it comes to room temperature.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, beat the cream until it doubles and has the consistency of whipped cream.</li>
                <li>Add the whipped cream to the pudding that has come to room temperature and mix it gently with the help of a spatula.</li>
                <li>Your pudding is ready when it is mixed homogeneously.</li>
                <li>You can decorate any serving bowl by placing biscuit pieces, sliced ​​strawberries and pudding in it. You can also decorate it in other ways that you like visually, it's up to your taste.</li>
                <li>Allow it to cool a little more in the refrigerator after taking it into serving containers. You can serve later.</li>
