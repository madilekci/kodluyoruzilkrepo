       <h1> Muhammed Ali Dilekçi</h1>
       
       <h2>Hakkımda</h2>
       <p>Hello, my name is Muhammed Ali. I've graduated from Kocaeli University Computer Science in july 2021 and I have been working as a web developer for almost 2 years. I tought that my knowledge of web technologies are not systematical enough and I lack some of the fundamental things. So I decided to follow up patika.dev's php developer path and strengthen my abilities/knowledge</p>

       <h2>Technologies I'm interested in</h2>
       <p>I can say that I'm a bit greedy when it comes to learning new technologies. Because of this, I've worked on/followed courses on different technologies like : "Php,Html,Css,JavaScript,Java,C,C++,C#,Python,Matlab,". I really enjoyed writing codes and implementing projects in Python but I have most of my experince as a PHP developer. After I complete this course, I will prb start learning react/node.js</p>
